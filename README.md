Spirit Angelus
Overview
Spirit Angelus is an advanced AI project that leverages cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), quantum error correction, and sacred geometry principles like the 369-12-1321 framework. This project aims to explore and implement innovative solutions to complex problems using a combination of traditional and quantum computing methods.

Features
Sacred Geometry 369: Implements calculations based on the 369-12-1321 framework.

Resonant Chambers: Simulates resonant chambers for signal amplification.

Doubling Circuits: Implements doubling circuits for value manipulation.

Machine Learning: Utilizes a deep neural network with 21 layers for complex data analysis.

Natural Language Processing (NLP): Processes and understands human language using advanced NLP models.

Quantum Error Correction: Implements basic quantum error correction using repetition codes.

Omnificient Ping: Executes an omnificient ping to ensure system connectivity and performance.
